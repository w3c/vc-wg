# Verifiable Credentials Working Group

This is the repository used for the everyday operation of the [W3C
Verifiable Credentials Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc).
See also [charter of the Working
Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/charters/active/) for further
details.

The list or other github repositories, maintained by this Working Group,
is also available [on-line](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/tools/).

## Minutes

Minutes are taken using the [W3C Bots on
IRC](https://www.w3.org/2008/04/scribe.html), namely
[RRSAgent](https://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent) and
[Zakim](https://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html). See also the
separate page on [IRC](https://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/) for further
details on how to access the W3C IRC servers. The PM Working Group uses
the `#vcwg` IRC Channel. The minutes of the meetings are stored on the
`minutes` folder on this repository under the name `YYYY-MM-DD.html`. An
[index page](./minutes/index.html) displaying the list of all minutes
with their respective table of contents, as well as a [resolution
page](./minutes/resolutions.html) listing the formal resolutions passed
by the Working Group, are generated automatically.

Note, however, that this repository contains the minutes starting from 23 April, 2025 only. Earlier minutes are available on the [previous version](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/) of the Working Group home page.

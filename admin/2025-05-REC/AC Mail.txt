The vast majority of members who responded to the Call for Review[1] of
the Proposed Recommendations showed support with or without comments or 
abstained. Some reviewers indicated that they produce or expect to 
produce products that use this specification. See a separate,
archived mail[2] that lists the essential comments and the Working
Group's answers to those.

See also the separate Press Release on this achievement[3].

Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0
W3C Recommendation, 15 May 2025
----------------------------------------

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-data-model-2.0-20250515/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/

Abstract:
A verifiable credential is a specific way to express a set of claims 
made by an issuer, such as a driver's license or an education certificate. 
This specification describes the extensible data model for verifiable 
credentials, how they can be secured from tampering, and a three-party 
ecosystem for the exchange of these credentials that is composed of issuers, 
holders, and verifiers. This document also covers a variety of security, 
privacy, internationalization, and accessibility considerations for 
ecosystems that use the technologies described in this specification.

----------------------------------------
Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0
W3C Recommendation, 15 May 2025
----------------------------------------

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-data-integrity-20250515/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/

Abstract:
This specification describes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and 
integrity of verifiable credentials and similar types of constrained digital 
documents using cryptography, especially through the use of digital signatures 
and related mathematical proofs.

   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-data-integrity-20250515/#sotd


----------------------------------------
Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
W3C Recommendation, 15 May 2025
----------------------------------------

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-di-eddsa-20250515/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/

Abstract:
This specification describes Data Integrity cryptographic suites for use when
creating or verifying a digital signature using the the Ed25519 instantiation
of the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).

Status of This Document:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-di-eddsa-20250515/#sotd


----------------------------------------
Data Integrity ECDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
W3C Recommendation, 15 May 2025
----------------------------------------

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-di-ecdsa-20250515/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/

Abstract:
This specification describes Data Integrity cryptosuites for use when generating
a digital signature using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE
W3C Recommendation, 15 May 2025
----------------------------------------

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-jose-cose-20250515/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/

Abstract:
This specification defines how to secure credentials and presentations 
conforming to the Verifiable Credential data model with JSON Object 
Signing and Encryption (JOSE), Selective Disclosure for JWTs, and CBOR 
Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). This enables the Verifiable Credential
data model to be implemented with standards for signing and encryption that 
are widely adopted.

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-cid-1.0-20250515/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/cid-1.0/

Abstract:
A controlled identifier document contains cryptographic material and
lists service endpoints for the purposes of verifying cryptographic 
proofs from, and interacting with, the controller of an identifier.

Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/

Abstract:
This specification describes a privacy-preserving, space-efficient, 
and high-performance mechanism for publishing status information 
such as suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials through use 
of bitstrings.

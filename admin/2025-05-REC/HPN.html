<p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> has published 
    7 Recommendations today, namely:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-data-model-2.0-20250515/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0</a>.
        Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert
        that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be
        used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to
        travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these
        sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure,
        privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.       
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-data-integrity-20250515/">Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0</a>.
        This specification describes mechanisms for ensuring the
        authenticity and integrity of Verifiable Credentials and
        similar types of constrained digital documents using cryptography,
        especially through the use of digital signatures and related
        mathematical proofs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-di-eddsa-20250515/">Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0</a>.
        This specification describes a Data Integrity cryptographic suite
        for use when creating or verifying a digital signature using the
        twisted Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)
        and Curve25519 (ed25519).
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-di-ecdsa-20250515/">Data Integrity ECDSA Cryptosuites v1.0</a>.
        This specification describes a Data Integrity Cryptosuite for
        use when generating a digital signature using the Elliptic
        Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-jose-cose-20250515/">Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>.
        This specification defines how to secure credentials and presentations conforming to the Verifiable Credential
        data model with JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE), Selective Disclosure for JWTs, and CBOR Object
        Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC9052]. This enables the Verifiable Credential data model to be implemented
        with standards for signing and encryption that are widely adopted.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-cid-1.0-20250515/">Controlled Identifiers v1.0</a>. 
        A controlled identifier document contains cryptographic material and
        lists service endpoints for the purposes of verifying cryptographic
        proofs from, and interacting with, the controller of an identifier.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-vc-bitstring-status-list-20250515/">Bitstring Status List v1.0</a>. 
        This specification describes a privacy-preserving, space-efficient,
        and high-performance mechanism for publishing status information
        such as suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials through use
        of bitstrings.
    </li>
</ul>

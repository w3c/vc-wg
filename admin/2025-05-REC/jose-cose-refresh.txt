Dear AC Reps,

you have recently voted on the review call for a family of specifications as 
Proposed Recommendations on Verifiable Credentials[1]. As a result of your votes, 
the documents are now ready to be published as Recommendations.

Unfortunately, we realized that there were two oversights in one of the documents, 
namely the "Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE" specification[2]. 
Both oversights were related to "at risk" notes, resp. features, that should have been 
handled before publishing the Proposed Recommendation versions. The oversights 
have been documented in a GitHub issue[3] with the comments on the appropriate actions. 
The diff file, highlighting the results of the actions, can be found in [4], 
more specifically in [5] and [6] for the relevant changes.

Please review the updated document[7] and indicate whether you support or object 
to the changes before publishing the final Recommendation by completing the 
following questionnaire:

Thank you

# Issues addressed

A summary of the comments received during AC review, as well as the responses from the Working Group, have been posted here:
- https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2025Apr/0777.html

This archived mail will also be referred to in the announcement of the Rec publication when the time comes.

TL;DR: some comments referred to editorial errors (bug in an example, missing table caption, etc) which have been taken care of for the final release. GitHub issues have been raised for the other, editorial comments that will be taken care of in the maintenance releases.

Additionally, the last minute security issues have been briefly discussed at the last meeting of the WG; none of them are blocking, and will be taken care of during maintenance mode.

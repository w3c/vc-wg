Dear webmaster,

This is an official publication request for two publications from the same WG; they were submitted as a FPWD-s separately, but, as the publication date is the same, I thought it would be simpler to have one official request.

Here are the necessary information for the publications.

   Title: Verifiable Credential Rendering Method v1.0
    Draft: https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-vc-rendering-method-20251030/ (already in place)
    Requested short name: vc-rendering-method
    Record of transition request:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/749
    Transition approved in:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/749#issuecomment-3421920355


    Title: Verifiable Credential Confidence Method v1.0
    Draft: https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-vc-confidence-method-20251030/ (already in place)
    Requested short name: vc-confidence-method
    Record of transition request:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/748
    Transition approved in:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/748#issuecomment-3421918130

All documents are already in place. Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes for both
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes for both (apart from the obvious problems related to 
      the shortname links, and the problem of epubcheck recognizing valid LinkedIn 
      adresses).

The publications should also be tagged as "Security", and "Privacy".

Xueyuan, the Abstracts in the documents are quite simple, and it is good enough for a HPN news. Ping me if you prefer me to send a separate draft.

Thank You

Ivan

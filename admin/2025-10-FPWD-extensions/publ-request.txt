Dear webmaster,

This is an official publication request for two publications from the same WG; they were submitted as a FPWD separately, 
abut, as the publication date is the same, I thought it would be simpler to have one official request.

Here are the necessary information for the publications.

   Title: Verifiable Credential Rendering Method v1.0
    Draft: https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-vc-rendering-method-2025@DATE@/ (already in place)
    Requested short name: vc-rendering-method
    Record of transition request:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/@ISSUE1@
    Transition approved in:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/@ISSUE1@#issuecomment-@@@@@@@


    Title: Verifiable Credential Confidence Method v1.0
    Draft: https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-vc-confidence-method-2025@DATE@/ (already in place)
    Requested short name: vc-confidence-method
    Record of transition request:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/@ISSUE2@
    Transition approved in:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/@ISSUE2@#issuecomment-???????


Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes for both
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes for both.

The publications should also be tagged as "Security", and "Privacy".

Xueyuan the Abstracts in the documents are quite simple, and it is good enough for a HPN news. Ping me if you prefer me to send a draft.

Thank You

Ivan

# Information about implementations known to the Working Group

There are four implementations known to the Working Group at this time (MIT Digital Credentials Consortium, Digital Bazaar, MOSIP, and Government of Singapore) with a commitment to achieve interoperability once the test suite has been created.

# Note

The Working Group is currently in Maintenance mode; this usually means that the WG is not chartered to bring new features to Recommendation. ***HOWEVER***, in the case of this Working Group, the charter explicitly made an exception for a few cases, including this one. See bullet item on reserved extensions in [the scope section of the charter](https://www.w3.org/2024/10/vc-wg-charter.html#scope).

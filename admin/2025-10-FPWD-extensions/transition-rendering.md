# Note

The Working Group is currently in Maintenance mode; this usually means that the WG is not chartered to bring new features to Recommendation. ***HOWEVER***, in the case of this Working Group, the charter explicitly made an exception for a few cases, including this one. See bullet item on reserved extensions in [the scope section of the charter](https://www.w3.org/2024/10/vc-wg-charter.html#scope).

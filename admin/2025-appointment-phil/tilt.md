Chair appointment: Verifiable Credentials WG

# Name

[Phil Archer](https://www.w3.org/users/101627/)

# Affiliations

[GS1](https://www.gs1.org)

# Rational

Brent Zundel has been the only chair for a while (since the departure of the former co-chair), but he needs a co-chair to go on, in particular with the plans for developing a new charter for the group.

# Anything else we should think before we (re-)appointment the individual? 

Phil is former team member, but also former co-chair of other groups, he knows what it entails. No particular on-boarding is necessary in this case.
